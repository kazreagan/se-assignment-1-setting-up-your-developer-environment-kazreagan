- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.
installing and setting up the above mentioned environments came with alot of challenges of which some are as follows;

Windows 11 Installation
1.Compatibility Issues:
-Challenge: my machine did not meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 11 because I did not run the compatibility test at first

-Solution: i did a compatibility test using the PC Health Check tool provided by Microsoft and i replaced replaced my video card

3.Insufficient Disk Space:
-Challenge: available disk space was not enough  for the installation.

-Solution: freed up space on my primary drive by deleting unnecessary files as well as moving some of them to an external drive.

4.Update Errors:
-Challenge: there were errors during the update process, such as download issues and installation failures.

-Solution: switched to a more stable internet connection, restarted my PC, and ran the Windows Update troubleshooter.

5.Driver Compatibility:
-Challenge: some drivers were not be compatible with Windows 11.
-Solution: updated my drivers and ran the installation again

Visual Studio Installation
1.Installation Freezing or Crashing:
-Challenge: ocassionally installation process would freezes or crash.

-Solution: closed all unnecessary applications and tried running the installer as an administrator.

2.Internet Connection Issues:
-Challenge: Poor internet connection leading to incomplete installation of files.

-Solution: switched to a more stable internet connection 

3.Configuration Issues:
